should we use #!/usr/bin/python3 or #!/usr/bin/env python3? or #!/usr/bin/python
or #!/usr/bin/env python

In this case we want to use the systems python3 (meaning #!/usr/bin/python3)
since we want these scripts to not use any python3 in any virutal env
used by user since that envrionment may not have the third party support that
we need to run these scripts and these scripts need to run independenty of how to virtual
env is configured.

Another thing is that now ubuntu has python3 as /usr/bin/python.

so the verdict?
/usr/bin/python

* Note: some special scripts, like pip_upgrade.py may need #!/usr/bin/env python
