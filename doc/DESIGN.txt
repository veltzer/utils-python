should we use #!/usr/bin/python3 or #!/usr/bin/env python3?

In this case we want to use the systems python3 (meaning #!/usr/bin/python3)
since we want these scripts to not use any python3 in any virutal env
used by user since that envrionment may not have the third party support that
we need to run these scripts.
